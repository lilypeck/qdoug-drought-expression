It contains leucine-rich repeats and an F-box and interacts with ASK1, ASK2 and AtCUL1 to form SCF-TIR1, an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Related to yeast Grr1p and human SKP2 proteins, involved in ubiquitin-mediated processes. Required for normal response to auxin and repressed in response to flagellin.    As part of the SCF complex and in the presence of auxin, TIR1 interacts with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins and mediates their degradation. Mutations in TIR1 block auxin stimulation of flavonoid synthesis.",none,none

AKT2 belongs to the Shaker family K+ channels which include the following groups based on phylogenetic analysis (FEBS Letters (2007) 581: 2357): I (inward rectifying channel): AKT1 (AT2G26650), AKT5 (AT4G32500) and SPIK (also known as AKT6, AT2G25600); II (inward rectifying channel): KAT1 (AT5G46240) and KAT2 (AT4G18290); III (weakly inward rectifying channel): AKT2 (AT4G22200); IV (regulatory subunit involved in inwardly rectifying conductance formation): KAT3 (also known as AtKC1, AT4G32650); V (outward rectifying channel): SKOR (AT3G02850) and GORK (AT5G37500).","F:PF00520.26, r:PF00023.25, r:PF13606.1",Ion transport protein /// Ankyrin repeat /// Ankyrin repeat
